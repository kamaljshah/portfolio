            <p> My main role in CHA (formerly Coler and Colantonio) was to maintain and develop new features to the propriety geospatial mapping software which interfaces ESRI's ArcMap Desktop Engine. The connection, routing / rerouting of software was done using a User Interface. Customers would raise a problem which were generated as tickets. The software currently named Novara Geospatial was primarily written in <b class="glow">C++</b> on MSVisual Studio. A <b class="glow">MSSQL Server</b> database named PODS was the backend for storing data. The developed software references the Pipeline Open Data Source (PODS). <b class="glow">Team Foundation Server (TFS)</b> was the version control system used for maintaining and releasing new versions of the software. <br/><br/><br/>
